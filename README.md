# Cemetech Contest 21
Learn the digits of pi in this fun game! I promise you, you won't want to stop playing until you know all of the digits of pi by heart.

The goal of the game is to see how many digits of pi you can remember (by heart)! Click the appropriate quadrant to add that digit to the board. If you click the wrong digit, you have to start over!
